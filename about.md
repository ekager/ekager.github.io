Hi! I'm Emily. I'm originally from the rolling farmland of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I studied neuroscience and classical studies at Penn in Philly, then got an MA in Interdisciplinary CS at Mills in Oakland.
M-F I'm a mobile developer in San Francisco working mostly on Android. On the weekends I'm either hiking, biking, running, skiing, or hanging out with my dogs.
